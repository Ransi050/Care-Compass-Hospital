        <p>The hospital's pediatric department is committed to ensuring the health and well-being 
            of infants, children, and adolescents. It provides immunization programs, routine check-ups, 
            treatment for childhood illnesses, and nutritional guidance. For newborns requiring 
            specialized care, the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is equipped to manage premature 
            and critically ill infants. Pediatricians and neonatal specialists work closely with families
             to provide comprehensive care, ensuring that young patients receive the best medical attention.
              The hospitalâ€™s child-friendly environment makes visits comfortable for children and their parents.</p>
