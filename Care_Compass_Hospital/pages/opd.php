        <p>Outpatient services at Care Compass Hospitals cater to patients who require medical attention 
            without the need for hospitalization. This includes consultations for minor illnesses, 
            routine check-ups, vaccinations, and prescription refills. Patients can walk in or schedule appointments
             with general physicians and specialists. The OPD service is designed to provide quick and efficient medical 
             assistance, ensuring that patients receive timely treatment. With flexible consultation hours and minimal waiting times, 
             the hospitalâ€™s OPD is a convenient solution for individuals seeking immediate but non-emergency medical care.</p>
